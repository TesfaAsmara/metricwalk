## How to use

``` python
import networkx as nx
from metricwalk.core import WireWalk
from metricwalk.functions import jaccard_coefficient

# Create a graph
graph = nx.fast_gnp_random_graph(n=100, p=0.5)

# Instantiate a WireWalk object
metricWalk = WireWalk(graph, dimensions = 128, window = 10, walk_length = 80, num_walks = 10, workers = 1)

# Precompute probabilities using preferential attachment, generate walks, and embed nodes
model = metricWalk.fit(jaccard_coefficient)
```
