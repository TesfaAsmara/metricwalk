Choice indexes include the Common Neighbors Index, Salton Index, Jaccard Index, Sorenson Index, Hub Promoted Index, Hub Depressed Index, Leicht-Holme-Newman Index, Preferential Attachment Index, Adamic-Adar Index, and Resource Allocation Index. These indexes each measure the similarity or strength of the connection between vertices $x$ and $y$, and assign weights accordingly to guide the random walk towards the next node. The choice of index should be based on the specific task and the nature of the network, as each index emphasizes different aspects of the network structure. \n",
